- add utility functions to lookup the namespace which contains a NetSuite type. Up to now,
only the types are comfortably accessible (as e.g. NetSuiteClient.Vendor) which are added in
`NetSuiteClient._complex_type_definitions`. Maybe overwrite `__getattribute__` of class `NetSuiteClient`.

- enhance search functionality (more complex searches than of type BasicSearch)

- add & test netsuite operations: add, update, delete

- refactor using decorator `request_service` for all request functions like get, search, upsert, ..
